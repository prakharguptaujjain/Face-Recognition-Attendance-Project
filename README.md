### First download the Face_Recognition.ipynb and open it using google colab ###
### Set the compute_vm to GPU in google colab ###
### Open Google Drive and in Colab Notebook Folder create a folder named ```face_recognition data``` as shown below ![Screenshot](https://github.com/prakharguptaujjain/MyFirst-Face-Recognition-Model/blob/main/referenceimages/image1.png) ###
### Inside ```face_recognition data``` folder create two new folders named ```DataSet``` and ```Test``` as shown below ![Screenshot](https://github.com/prakharguptaujjain/MyFirst-Face-Recognition-Model/blob/main/referenceimages/image2.png) ###
### Now just all the images you have in the ```DataSet``` folder and put the images you want to recognize face in ```Test``` folder ###
### Now for first time you need to run all the cells, but afterwards no need to run cell no.4 (in that cell a comment is also written regarding the same) ###
## Now just rock üëçüëç ##
